## How It Works

1. The user enters the website and the email/password.

2. The user can enter a password or let the application generate one (which will be copied to clipboard).

3. When clicking "Add", the application checks to see if there are no empty fields, and then saves the data in a .json file locally.

4. When clicking "Search", the application checks to see if there is any data related to the searched website, and returns it.

## Libraries & Software Used
